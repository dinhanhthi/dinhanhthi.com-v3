I'm **Thi**, a Vietnamese guy who has a curious mind. As an never-stop-learning mathematician, I am interested in researching and sharing contents about *applied maths* with its applications, *computer science* and *software tools* which are helpful to human life. I have a **Ph.D. degree in Applied Mathematics** at [Université Sorbonne Paris Nord](https://www.math.univ-paris13.fr){:target="_blank"}, France.

After my Ph.D., I worked at [Dataswati](https://www.dataswati.com/) as a Data Scientist, a company who helps Food&Beverage Industries more efficient today and more resilient to climatic. <mark markdown='span'>**I am currently looking for a job as a Data Scientist**</mark>.

I use [this website]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/notes) and [this one](https://rawnote.dinhanhthi.com "My personal notes"){:target="_blank"} to document everything I learned while going through the process of learning and working in this field. I also like to write about intuitive maths. I'm an admin of **[Math2IT](https://math2it.com){:target="_blank"}**, a Vietnamese community about maths, education, and technology.

My hobbies are [drawing](https://photos.app.goo.gl/9OVEkdTjmtRPg7vC3){:target="_blank"}, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19630622-thi-dinh){:target="_blank"} and [cooking](https://goo.gl/photos/yQXdQws1LLS16x5v5){:target="_blank"}.

I've started to learn to be a ***data engineer*** / ***data scientist*** from the field of numerical analysis (my [Github repository](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/data-science-learning){:target="_blank"}).

- **1/2020 - 11/2020** &mdash; Data Scientist at [Dataswati](https://www.dataswati.com/) (end probationary period because of economic problem). My role was to ameliorate the library `popai`, a tool Dataswati uses to work on their projects. I worked much on _Time Series_, _Clutering_, _Anomaly Detection_ and _Data Processing_. I also worked on Data Controller (a tool Dataswati built for connecting everything - Dev, Data, Research, Frontend, Backend).

{% include heading-title.html title="Web Development" icon="fas fa-globe-asia" more="note taking" href="/notes#web_development" %}

I've totally learned by myself, created website Math2IT and designed some websites.

- **2020 - now**
  - Master on creating a website with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).
- **2019**
  - Following [Web Development path](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development){:target="_blank"} on Codecademy & keep designing some templates.
  - Create [note.dinhanhthi.com](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/note), a jekyll theme specialized for note taking.
  - Create [simple-perso](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/simple-perso), a simple and beautiful personal jekyll theme.
- **2018** &mdash; I learned to write a Wordpress theme from screatch and created [math2itwp](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/math2itwp){:target="_blank"} which is a beautiful Wordpress theme.
- **2014 - 2017** &mdash; I started to learn Jekyll and how to create a static website.

{% include heading-title.html title="Learning Maths" icon="fas fa-square-root-alt" %}

I have learned math since the beginning of my study life and keep writing about math under an intuitive way.

- **2018 - today** &mdash; I keep studying about maths, especially about its application in life. I write about it on [Math2IT](https://math2it.com){:target="_blank"} (in Vietnamese) under an accessible and intuitive way so that Vietnamese people no longer see maths as useless.
- **2014 - 2018** &mdash; Ph.D. researcher in applied maths at [LAGA, Université Sorbonne Paris Nord](https://www.math.univ-paris13.fr/applications/accueil/index.html){:target="_blank"}.

{% include heading-title.html title="Ph.D. Research" icon="fas fa-graduation-cap" %}

I researched on the growth of [biofilm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm){:target="_blank"} by using [Finite Element Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method){:target="_blank"}, [Level Set Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level-set_method){:target="_blank"} and some other numerical ones for an interface problem. For the implementation and simulation, I first used [FreeFem++](https://freefem.org/){:target="_blank"} and later developed by myself the [NXFEM](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/nxfem){:target="_blank"}, a Matlab toolbox.

- **3 presentations** about biofilm growth model & numrical methods & application of FreeFem++.
- **6 conferences** about biofilm & biology & numerical methods.
- **1 additional project** proposed by [IFPEN](https://www.ifpenergiesnouvelles.com/){:target="_blank"} in 11th Semaine d'Étude Maths-Entreprises ([SEME](https://www.agence-maths-entreprises.fr/a/?q=fr/node/13){:target="_blank"}).
