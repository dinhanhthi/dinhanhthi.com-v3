This is the final project for the course "[Applied Data Science Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone)" given by IBM on Coursera. We will explore the venues in different districts of Ho Chi Minh City to find the best place to set up our business.

## Data presentation

In order to explore the previous questions, we need to use the following data in the research.

1. [List of Ho Chi Minh City administrative units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City){:target="_blank"} from Wikipedia.
2. List of the coordinates (latitude, longitude) of all urban districts in HCMC. This list can be generated based on the name of each district and package *geopy.geocoders.Nominatim*.
3. [List of average housing prices](https://mogi.vn/gia-nha-dat){:target="_blank"} per $m^2$ in HCMC.
4. A `.json` file contains all coordinates where we use it to create a choropleth map of Housing Sales Price Index of HCMC. I create this file by myself using [OpenStreetMap](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org){:target="_blank"}.

## Methodology (TL;DR;)

- **Get the data**:
  - Scrape the data from a website using `requests` and `bs4.BeautifulSoup`: data of districts (`df_hcm`) and data of housing price (`df_housing_price`).
  - Using `geopy.geocoders.Nominatim` to find coordinates (longitude, latitude) of districts based on their name.
- Using `folium` to plot the map.
- Using [Foursquare API](https://foursquare.com/developers/login?continue=%2Fdevelopers%2Fapps) to find the venues of each district.
- Explore the venues in each district:
  - List of unique categories.
  - Number of venues in each district.
  - Number of venues in each category.
  - Number of categories in each district.
- **Data preprocessing**: 
  - Remove all `,` in a number.
  - Create new feature called `Density` which is the population over area.
  - Remove word `District` and only keep the name of that district.
  - Remove Vietnamese accents.
  - Merge 2 dataframes into 1 `df`.
  - Using `pd.get_dummies()` to convert categorical features into dummy ones (one-hot encoding).
- Using `groupby` to find the top 10 venue categories for each district.
- Using [K-Means clustering](/k-means) to cluster districts by category. We try with different values of `k` and use the "elbow" method to choose the best `k` for the K-Means.
- Next, we examine the range of Average Housing Price (AHP): low, medium, high and very high.
- Finally, based on the map, we can choose the best district to set up our business: the one in which there are a lot of people living there (high density), there are not many already-working café and the average housing price is low.
