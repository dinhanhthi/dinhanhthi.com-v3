## What?

## Why & When?

- Very effective at computer vision (e.g. recognizing cats, dogs, planes, and even hot dogs)
- Why not feedforward neural networks (FNN)?
  - FNN do not take into account the spatial structure of the pixels
  - FNN learns global relationships in the features instead of local patterns. 

## How?

### Keras

### PyTorch

### TensorFlow
