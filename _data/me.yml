index-intro: "Hi there! I'm <span style='color: #fff;'><strong>Thi</strong></span>, a math lover, a coder and an autodidact from Vietnam. I love to learn something new everyday. I write about what I've learned in an accessible and intuitive way because I do agree with Einstein that \"<i>If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.</i>\"."
