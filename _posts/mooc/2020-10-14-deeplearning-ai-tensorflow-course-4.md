## Sequences and prediction

### Time Series

ðŸ‘‰ Notebook: [introduction to time series](https://dinhanhthi.com/github-html?https://github.com/dinhanhthi/deeplearning.ai-courses/blob/master/TensorFlow%20in%20Practice/course-4/week-1/notebook_1_introduction_to_time_series.html). + [explaining video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction/lecture/Pzp5K/introduction-to-time-series). => How to create synthetic time series data + plot them.

{:.noindent}
- Time series is everywhere: stock prices, weather focasts, historical trends (Moore's law),...
- **Univariate** TS and **Miltivariate** TS.
- Type of things can we do with ML over TS:
  - Any thing has a time factor can be analysed using TS.
  - Predicting a focasting (eg. birth & death in Japan -> predict future for retirement, immigration, impacts...).
  - __Imputation__: project back into the past.
  - Fill holes in the data.
  - Nomalies detecction (website attacks).
  - Spot patterns (eg. speed recognition).
- Common patterns in TS:
  - __Trend__: a specific direcion that they're moving in.

    {:.img-50}
    ![Trend]({{img_url}}/trend.png)
  - __Seasonality__: patterns repeat at predictable intervals (eg. active users for a website).

    {:.img-100}
    ![seasonality]({{img_url}}/seasonality.png)
  - Combinition of both **trend** and **seasonality**.

    {:.img-50}
    ![trend+seasonality]({{img_url}}/trend_seasonality.png)
  - __Stationary__ TS.

    {:.img-50}
    ![stationality]({{img_url}}/stationality.png)
  - __Autocorrelated__ TS: a time series is linearly related to a _lagged_ version of itself.. There is no trend, no seasonality.

    {:.img-60}
    ![autocorrelation]({{img_url}}/autocorrelation.png)
  - __Multiple auto correlation__.

    {:.img-60}
    ![multiple_autocorrelation]({{img_url}}/multiple_autocorrelation.png)
  - May be **trend** + **seasonality** + **autorrelation** + **noise**.

    {:.img-60}
    ![trend_seasonality_autocorrelation_noise]({{img_url}}/trend_seasonality_autocorrelation_noise.png)
  - **Non-stationary** TS:

    {:.img-60}
    ![non_stationary]({{img_url}}/non_stationary.png)
    _In this case, we base just on the later data to predict the future (not on the whole data)._

### Train / Validation / Test

- **Fixed partitioning** (this course focuses on) =  splitting TS data into **training period**, **validation period** and **test period**.
  - If TS is seasonal, we want each period contains the whole number of seasons.

    {:.img-70}
    ![Fixed partitioning]({{img_url}}/fixed_partitioning.png)

- We can split + train + test to get a model and then **re-train** with the data **containing also the test period** so that the model is optimized! In that case, the test set comes from the future.

    {:.img-70}
    ![Fixed partitioning with test period comes from the future]({{img_url}}/fixed_partitioning_future_test.png)
- **Roll-forward partitioning**: we start with a short training period and we gradually increase it (1 day at a time or 1 week at a time). At each iteration, we train the model on training period, use it to focast the following day/week in the validation period. = Fixed partitioning in a number of times!

    {:.img-70}
    ![Roll-forward partitioning]({{img_url}}/roll_forward_partitioning.png)

### Metrics

For evaluating models:

``` python
errors = forecasts - actual

# Mean squared error (square to get rid of negative values)
# Eg. Used if large errors are potentially dangerous
mse = np.square(errors).mean()
# Get back to the same scale to error
rmse = np.sqrt(mse)

# Mean absolute error (his favorite)
# this doesn't penalize large errs as much as mse does,
# used if loss is proportional to the size of err
mae = np.abs(errors).mean()

# Mean abs percentage err
# idea of the size of err compared to the values
mape = np.abs(errors / x_valid).mean()
```

``` python
# MAE with TF
keras.metrics.mean_absolute_error(x_valid, naive_forecast).numpy()
```

### Moving average and differencing

ðŸ‘‰ Notebook: [Forecasting](https://dinhanhthi.com/github-html?https://github.com/dinhanhthi/deeplearning.ai-courses/blob/master/TensorFlow%20in%20Practice/course-4/week-1/notebook_2_forecasting.html). + [explaining video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction/lecture/KVWrR/forecasting).

**Moving average**: a simple forecasting method. Calculate the average of blue lines within a fixed "averaging windows".

- This can eliminate noises and doesn't anticipate trend or seasonality.
- Depend on the "averaging window", it can give worse result than naive forecast.

{:.img-70}
![Moving average]({{img_url}}/moving_average.png)
_Take the average on each yellow window. MAE=7.14 (optimal is 4)._

``` python
def moving_average_forecast(series, window_size):
    """Forecasts the mean of the last few values.
        If window_size=1, then this is equivalent to naive forecast"""
    forecast = []
    for time in range(len(series) - window_size):
    forecast.append(series[time:time + window_size].mean())
    return np.array(forecast)
```

**Differencing**: remove the trend and seasonality from the TS. We study on the differences between points and their previous neighbor in period.

{:.img-100}
![Moving average on differenced time series]({{img_url}}/moving_avg_on_differenced_ts.jpg)
_Left image: we find the differencing of original values, then we find the average (orange line). Right image: restore the trend and seasonality. MAE=5.8 (optimal is 4)._

Above method still get the noises (because we add the differencing to the previous noise). If we remove past noise using moving average on that.

{:.img-70}
![Smoothing both past and present values]({{img_url}}/smoothing_both_past_present_values.png)
_Smoothing both past and present values. MAE=4.5 (optimal is 4)._

Keep in mind before using Deep Learning, <mark>sometimes simple approaches just work fine!</mark>

## Deep NN for Time Series

### Preparing features and labels

- We need to split our TS data into features and labels so that we can use them in ML algos.
- In this case: features=#values in TS, label=next_value.
  - Feature: window size and train to predict next value.
  - Ex: 30 days of values as features and next value as label.
  - Overtime, train ML to match 30 features to match a single label.

ðŸ‘‰ Notebook: [Preparing features and labels](https://dinhanhthi.com/github-html?https://github.com/dinhanhthi/deeplearning.ai-courses/blob/master/TensorFlow%20in%20Practice/course-4/week-2/notebook_1_preparing_features_and_labels.html).<br />
ðŸ‘‰ [Video explains how to split to features and labels from dataset](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction/lecture/TYErD/preparing-features-and-labels).

``` python
def windowed_dataset(series, window_size, batch_size, shuffle_buffer):
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(series)
    dataset = dataset.window(window_size + 1, shift=1, drop_remainder=True)
    dataset = dataset.flat_map(lambda window: window.batch(window_size + 1))
    dataset = dataset.shuffle(shuffle_buffer).map(lambda window: (window[:-1], window[-1]))
    dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size).prefetch(1)
    return dataset
```

{% hsbox Explaine the codes %}
``` python
# create a very simple dataset
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.range(6)
arr = [val.numpy() for val in dataset]
print(arr)
# [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

``` python
# make equal (drop_remaninder) windows
dataset = dataset.window(5, shift=1, drop_remainder=True)
dataset = dataset.flat_map(lambda window: window.batch(5))
    # instead of val.numpy for each val in each window
for window in dataset:
    print(window.numpy())
# [0 1 2 3 4]
# [1 2 3 4 5]
```

``` python
# split the last value to be label
dataset = dataset.map(lambda window: (window[:-1], window[-1:]))
# [0 1 2 3] [4]
# [1 2 3 4] [5]
```

``` python
# shuffle
dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=6)
# construct batch of 2
dataset = dataset.batch(2).prefetch(1)
# x =  [[1 2 3 4], [0 1 2 3]]
# y =  [[5], [4]]
```
{% endhsbox %}

## Sequence bias

Sequence bias is when the order of things can impact the selection of things. <mark>It's ok to shuffle!</mark>

## Feeding windowed datasets into NN

ðŸ‘‰ Notebook: [Single layer NN](https://dinhanhthi.com/github-html?https://github.com/dinhanhthi/deeplearning.ai-courses/blob/master/TensorFlow%20in%20Practice/course-4/week-2/notebook_2_1layer_NN_linear_reg.html) + [video explains it](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction/lecture/YERBd/more-on-single-layer-neural-network).

``` python
# Simple linear regression (1 layer NN)
dataset = windowed_dataset(x_train, window_size, batch_size, shuffle_buffer_size)
l0 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=[window_size])
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([l0])
model.compile(loss="mse", optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(lr=1e-6, momentum=0.9))
model.fit(dataset,epochs=100,verbose=0)
print("Layer weights {}".format(l0.get_weights()))

forecast = []

for time in range(len(series) - window_size):
    forecast.append(model.predict(series[time:time + window_size][np.newaxis]))
    # np.newaxis: reshape X to input dimension that used by the model

forecast = forecast[split_time-window_size:]
results = np.array(forecast)[:, 0, 0]
```

## RNN for TS

{:.noindent}
- RRN is a NN containing Recurrent layer.
- The different from DNN is the input shape is __3 dimensional__ (`batch_size x #time_step x dims_input_at each_timestep`).
- Re-use 1 cell multiple times in different layers (in this course).

_Idea of how RNN works with TS data. The current location can be impacted more by the nearby locations._

### Shape of input to RNN

ðŸ‘‰ [Video explains the dimensional and sequence-to-vector RNN](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction/lecture/fP3ND/shape-of-the-inputs-to-the-rnn).

{:.noindent}
- Suppose: _window size_ of 30 time steps, _batch size_ of 4: Shape will be 4x30x1 and the _memory cell_ input will be 4x1 matrix.
- If the memory cell comprises 3 neurons then the _output matrix_ will be 4x3. Therefore, the full output of the layer will be 4x30x3.
- $H_i$ is just a copy of $Y_i$.
- Below figure: input and also output a sequence.

{:.img-100}
![Dimension of input to RNN.]({{img_url}}/rnn_ts_dim.png)
_Dimension of input to RNN._

### Sequence to vector RNN

{:.noindent}
- Sometimes, we want only input a sequence but not output. This called __sequence-to-vector RNN__. I.E., <mark>ignore all of the outputs except the last one!</mark>. In `tf.keras`, it's default setting!

{:.img-100}
![Sequence to vector RNN.]({{img_url}}/rnn_ts_sequence_to_vector.png)
_Sequence to vector RNN._

``` python
# Check the figure below as an illustration
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(20, return_sequences=True, input_shape=[None, 1]),
    # input_shape:
    #   TF assumes that 1st dim is batch size -> any size at all -> no need to define
    #   None -> number of time steps, None means RNN can handle sequence of any length
    #   1 -> univariate TS
tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(20),
    # if there is `return_sequences=True` -> sequence-to-sequence RNN
tf.keras.layers.Dense(1),
])
```

_Illustration with keras._

### Lambda layer

ðŸ‘‰ [Video explains the use of lambda layer in RNN.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction/lecture/I0K6b/lambda-layers).

``` python
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Lambda(lambda x: tf.expand_dims(x, axis=-1), # expand to 1 dim (from 2) so that we have 3 dims: batch size x #timesteps x series dim
                        input_shape=[None]), # can use any size of sequences
    tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(40, return_sequences=True),
    tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(40),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1),
    tf.keras.layers.Lambda(lambda x: x * 100.0)
        # default activation in RNN is tanh -> (-1, 1) -> scale to -100, 100
])
```

### Simple RNN

{:.noindent}
- Loss function __Huber__ ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huber_loss)): less sensitive to outliers. => we use this because our data in this case get a little bit noisy!

ðŸ‘‰ Notebook: [Simple RNN with a TS data](https://dinhanhthi.com/github-html?https://github.com/dinhanhthi/deeplearning.ai-courses/blob/master/TensorFlow%20in%20Practice/course-4/week-3/notebook_1_simple_RNN_with_TS.html) + [videos explains it](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction/lecture/5W1Rw/rnn).

### LSTM

## Real-world time series data

{:.noindent}
- We are going to predict the __sunspot actitivity cycles__ ([download dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/robervalt/sunspots)).
