## What?

K-Shape clustering method is a method for <mark>clustering time series</mark>.

The main ideas of this algorithms are:

- The distance measure is based on the cross-correlation of two time series.
- The clustering process uses iterative approaches.
- It is a raw-based method. It is fundamentally a variant of k-means with some interesting modification.
  - Define a distance between 2 time series.
  - How to average multiple time series.
