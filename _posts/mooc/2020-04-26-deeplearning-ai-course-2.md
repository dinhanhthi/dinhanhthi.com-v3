## Initialization step

`layers_dims` contains the size of each layer from $0$ to $L$.

### zero initialization

``` python
parameters['W'+str(l)] = np.zeros((layers_dims[l], layers_dims[l-1]))
parameters['b'+str(l)] = np.zeros((layers_dims[l], 1))
```

- The performance is really **bad**, and the **cost** does **not** really **decrease**.
- initializing all the weights to zero â‡’ failing to break symmetry â‡’ every neuron in each layer will learn the same thing â‡’ $n^{[l]}=1$ for every layer â‡’ no more powerful than a linear classifier such as logistic regression.

### Random initialization

<mark>To break symmetry</mark>, lets intialize the weights randomly.

``` python
parameters['W'+str(l)] = np.random.randn(layers_dims[l], layers_dims[l-1]) * 10 # <- LARGE (just an example of SHOULDN'T)
parameters['b'+str(l)] = np.zeros((layers_dims[l], 1))
```

- High initial weights â‡’ The cost starts very high (near 0 or 1 or infinity).
- Poor initialization â‡’ vanishing/exploding gradients â‡’ slows down the optimization algorithm.
- If you train this network longer â‡’ better results, BUT initializing with overly large random numbers â‡’ slows down the optimization.

### He initialization

Multiply randomly initial $W$ with $\sqrt{\frac{2}{n^{[l-1]}}}$. It's similar to **Xavier initialization** in which multipler factor is $\sqrt{\frac{1}{n^{[l-1]}}}$

``` python
parameters['W' + str(l)] = np.random.randn(layers_dims[l], layers_dims[l-1]) * np.sqrt(2./layers_dims[l-1])
parameters['b' + str(l)] = np.zeros((layers_dims[l], 1))
```

## Regularization step

To reduce the **overfitting problem**.

### L2 regularization

``` python
L2_regularization_cost = 0
for l in range(1, L+1):
    L2_regularization_cost += 1/m * lambd/2 * (np.sum(np.square(W[l]))
```

- The standard way. Modify cost function from,
    $$J = -\frac{1}{m} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{m} \large{(}\small  y^{(i)}\log\left(a^{[L](i)}\right) + (1-y^{(i)})\log\left(1- a^{[L](i)}\right) \large{)}$$
    to
    $$J_{regularized} = \small \underbrace{-\frac{1}{m} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{m} \large{(}\small y^{(i)}\log\left(a^{[L](i)}\right) + (1-y^{(i)})\log\left(1- a^{[L](i)}\right) \large{)} }_\text{cross-entropy cost} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{m} \frac{\lambda}{2} \sum\limits_l\sum\limits_k\sum\limits_j W_{k,j}^{[l]2} }_\text{L2 regularization cost}$$
- The value of $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter that you can tune using a dev set.
- L2 regularization makes your decision boundary smoother. If $\lambda$ is too large, it is also possible to "oversmooth", resulting in a model with high bias.

### Dropout

``` python
# [Forward] An example at layer 3
D3 = np.random.rand(A3.shape(0), A3.shape(1)) < keep_drop
A3 *= D3
A3 /= keep_drop
# [Backprop]
dA3 *= D3
dA3 /= keep_drop
```

- <mark>Dropout is a widely used regularization technique that is specific to deep learning</mark>.
- Randomly shuts down some neurons in each iteration.
- When you shut some neurons down, you actually modify your model. <mark>The idea behind drop-out</mark> is that at each iteration, you train a different model that uses only a subset of your neurons.
- With dropout, your neurons thus become <mark>less sensitive to the activation</mark> of one other specific neuron, because that other neuron might be shut down at any time.
- Don't apply dropout to the input layer or output layer.
- Use dropout during training, not during test time.
- Apply dropout both during forward and backward propagation.

## Gradient checking

- To answer <mark markdown="span">"_Give me a proof that your backpropagation is actually working!"_</mark>
- We are confident on computing $J$ but $\frac{\partial J}{\partial\theta}$.
- Use $J$ to compute an approximation of $\frac{\partial J}{\partial\theta}$ and compare with $\frac{\partial J}{\partial\theta}$.
    $$ \frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta} = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \frac{J(\theta + \varepsilon) - J(\theta - \varepsilon)}{2 \varepsilon}$$

## Optimization algorithms

**Intuition**:

- **Gradient Descent**: go down the hill.
- **Momentum** / **RMSprop** / **Adam**: which direction?

### Mini-batch gradient descent

- **Problem**: NN works great on big data but many data leads to slow the training â‡’ We need to optimize!
- **Solution**: Divide into smaller "mini-batches" (for example, from 5M to 5K of 1K each).

$$
\begin{aligned}
X_{(n_X, m=5M)} &= [\underbrace{X^{(1)},\ldots,X^{(1K)}}_{X^{\{1\}}_{(n_X,1K)}}, \underbrace{X^{(1K+1)},\ldots,X^{(2K)}}_{X^{\{2\}}_{(n_X,1K)}}, \ldots, \underbrace{X^{(m-1K+1)},\ldots,X^{(m)}}_{X^{\{5K\}}_{(n_X,1K)}}], \\
Y_{(1, m=5M)} &= [\underbrace{y^{(1)},\ldots,y^{(1K)}}_{Y^{\{1\}}_{(1,1K)}}, \underbrace{y^{(1K+1)},\ldots,y^{(2K)}}_{Y^{\{2\}}_{(1,1K)}}, \ldots, \underbrace{y^{(m-1K+1)},\ldots,y^{(m)}}_{Y^{\{5K\}}_{(1,1K)}}]
\end{aligned}
$$

{:.img-80}
![Different between mini-batch and normal batch]({{img-url}}/batch-vs-mini-batch.png)
_Different between mini-batch and normal batch on the cost function. It's oscillated for mini-batch because the cost may be large for this mini-batch but small for the others. Image from the course._

#### Notations

- $X^{(i)}$: $i$th training example.
- $z^{[l]}$: $z$ value in $l$th layer.
- $X^{\{t\}}, Y^{\{t\}}$: index of different mini-batches.

#### Algorithm

``` python
X = data_input
Y = labels
parameters = initialize_parameters(layers_dims)
for i in range(0, num_iterations): # loop through epoches: to get the convergence
    for t in range(0, num_batches): # loop through the batches
        # Forward propagation
        a, caches = forward_propagation(X[:,t], parameters)
        # Compute cost
        cost += compute_cost(a, Y[:,t])
        # Backward propagation
        grads = backward_propagation(a, caches, parameters)
        # Update parameters.
        parameters = update_parameters(parameters, grads)
```

#### How to build mini-batches?

We need 2 steps:

1. **Shuffle**: shuffle columns (training examples) correspondingly between $X$ and $Y$. The shuffling step ensures that examples will be split randomly into different mini-batches.
2. **Partition**: choose a batch size and take mini-batches. Note that, the last batch may be smaller than the others.

#### Type of mini-batch

There are 3 types based on the size of batches:

1. **Batch Gradient Descent** ($n_t = m$) : entire training examples, i.e. $(X^{\{1\}}, Y^{\{1\}}) = (X,Y)$.
2. **Stochastic Gradient Descent** ($n_t = 1$) : every training example is it own a mini-batch ($m$ mini batches).
3. $1<n_t<m$.

{:.img-70}
![Different between 3 types of mini-batch.]({{img-url}}/batch-vs-mini-batch-2.png)
_Different between 3 types of mini-batch. Image from the course._

<mark markdown='span'>**Guideline**</mark>:

- If small training set ($m \le 2000$): using batch gradient descent.
- Typical mini-batch sizes: $64, 128, 256, 512, \ldots$
- Make sure mibi-batch size in CPU/GPU memory!

### Exponentially weighted averages

- It's faster than Gradient Descent!
- **Example** (temperature in London):
    - $\theta_t$: the temperature on day $t$.
    - $v_t$: the average temp of each day. It's called exponential average over $\frac{1}{1-\beta}$ days temperature.
        $$
        v_t = \beta v_{t-1} + (1-\beta)\theta_t
        $$
    - E.g. $\beta=0.9 \Rightarrow v_t \simeq 10$ days temperature; $\beta=0.98 \Rightarrow v_t \simeq 50$ days temperature.
- $\beta$ larger â‡’ smoother average line because we consider more days. However, curve is now shifted further to the right.

{:.img-50}
![Exponentially weighted average curves.]({{img-url}}/exponentially-weighted-average.png)
_Exponentially weighted average curves: red line ($\beta=0.9$), green line ($\beta=0.98$). Image from the course._

- When $\beta$ is so large â‡’ $v_t$ adapts slowly to the changes of temperature  (more latency).
- Why we call "exponentially"?
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    v_{100} &= 0.9\times v_{99} + 0.1\times \theta_{100}\\
    &= 0.1\times \theta_{100} + 0.1\times 0.99\times\theta_{99} + 0.1\times 0.99^2 \times\theta_{99} + \ldots
    \end{aligned}
    $$

#### Bias correction

- **Problem**: the value of $v_t$ at the beginning of exp ave curves may be lower than what we expect. For example, with $v_0=0$, we have $v_1 = 0.02\theta_1$ instead of $v_1 = v_0 + 0.02\theta_1$.
- **Solution**: Instead of using $v_t$, we take
    $$
    \dfrac{v_t}{1-\beta_t}
    $$
- When $t$ is large â‡’ $\beta^t \simeq 0 \Rightarrow \dfrac{v_t}{1-\beta_t} \simeq v_t$

{:.img-50}
![Bias correction.]({{img-url}}/bias-correction.png)
_Bias correction for the green line, it's effective at the beginning of the line, with bigger $t$, green and violet are overlapped. Image from the course._

- <mark markdown='span'>**In practice**</mark>, we don't really see people bothering with bias correction!

### Gradient Descent with Momentum

- It's faster than Gradient Descent!
- **Why**: when we use mini-batch, there are oscillation, momentum helps use reduce this.
- **One sentence**: compute the exponential weighted average of your gradient â‡’ use that gradient to update your weights instead.
- **Idea**: Momentum takes into account the past gradients to smooth out the update. We will store the 'direction' of the previous gradients in the variable $v$ . Formally, this will be the exponentially weighted average of the gradient on previous steps.
- **Intuition**: You can also think of $v$ as the "velocity" of a ball rolling downhill, building up speed (and momentum) according to the direction of the gradient/slope of the hill.
  - $dW, db$ like "acceleration".
  - $VdW, Vdb$ like "velocity".
  - $\beta$ likes "friction".

{:.img-70}
![Momentum.]({{img-url}}/momentum.png)
_We want slower learning in vertial direction and faster in horizontal direction. Image from the course._

- **Algorithm**: on iteration $t$:
  1. Compute $dW, db$ on current mini-batch.
  2. $VdW = \beta VdW + (1-\beta)dW$.
  3. $Vdb = \beta Vdb + (1-\beta)db$.
  4. $W:=W-\alpha VdW$.
  5. $b:=b-\alpha Vdb$.
- **Implementation**:
  - Try to tune between $[0.8; 0.999]$, commonly use $\beta=0.9$.
  - Don't bother bias correction, NO NEED.
  - Don't need $(1-\beta)$ in the formulas but Andrew prefer to keep it!
  - Bigger $\beta$, smaller in vertical direction.

### RMSprop

- It's "Root Mean Square propagation".
- **Algorithm**: on iteration $t$,
    1. Compute $dW, db$ on current element-wise mini-batch.
    2. $SdW = \beta SdW + (1-\beta)dW^2$.
    3. $Sdb = \beta Sdb + (1-\beta)db^2$.
    4. $W:=W -\alpha \frac{dW}{\sqrt{SdW}+\epsilon}$.
    5. $b:=b-\alpha \frac{db}{\sqrt{SdW} + \epsilon}$.
- We choose $\epsilon=10^{-8}$ if $\sqrt{SdW}$ is too small, otherwise $\epsilon=0$.
- **In practice**: $dW, db$ are very high dimensional vectors.

### Adam Optimization

- It's "Adaptive Moment Estimation".
- <mark>One of the most effective optimization algorithm for training NN</mark>. It's commonly used and proven to be very effective for many different NN of a very wide variety of architectures.
- Adam = Momentum + RMSprop.
- **Implementation**: on iteration $t$,
    1. Compute $dW, db$ using current mini-batch.
    2. (Monentum) $VdW = \beta_1 VdW + (1-\beta_1)dW$; $Vdb = \beta_1 Vdb+(1-\beta_1)db$.
    3. (RMSprop) $SdW = \beta_2 SdW + (1-\beta_2)dW^2$; $Sdb = \beta_2Sdb +(1-\beta_2)db^2$.
    4. $V_{dW}^{\text{corrected}} = \dfrac{VdW}{1-\beta_1^t}$; $V_{db}^{\text{corrected}} = \dfrac{Vdb}{1-\beta_1^t}$.
    5. $S_{dW}^{\text{corrected}} = \dfrac{SdW}{1-\beta_2^t}$; $S_{db}^{\text{corrected}} = \dfrac{Sdb}{1-\beta_2^t}$.
    6. $W:=W-\alpha \dfrac{V_{dW}^{\text{corrected}}}{\sqrt{S_{dW}^{\text{corrected}}} + \epsilon}$; $b:=b-\alpha \dfrac{V_{db}^{\text{corrected}}}{\sqrt{S_{db}^{\text{corrected}}} + \epsilon}$.
- **Initialization** of the velocity is zero, i.e. $VdW=SdW=Vdb=Sdb=0$.
- If $\beta=0$, it's standard gradient descent without momentum.
- **Hyperparameter choices**:
  - $\alpha$ = needs to be tuned, very important!
  - $\beta_1 = 0.9$ ($dW$), first moment.
  - $\beta_2 = 0.999$ ($dW^2$), second mement.
  - $\epsilon = 10^{-8}$.

## Learning rate decay

- **Idea**: slowly reduce learning rate over time, it's learning rate decay.
- **Why**? Below figure showes that, we need slower rate $\alpha$ (smaller step) at the area near the center.

{:.img-70}
![Learning rate decay.]({{img-url}}/learning-rate-decay.png)
_Example of learning rate decay. Image from the course._

- Recall that, 1 epoch = 1 pass through data.
- Learning rate decay can be chosen 1 of below,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\alpha &= \dfrac{1}{1 + \text{decay\_rate} \times \text{epoch\_num}} \times \alpha_0, \\
\alpha &= 0.95^{\text{epoch\_num}} \times \alpha_0 - \text{exponentially\_decay}, \\
\alpha &= \dfrac{k}{\sqrt{\text{epoch\_number}}} \times \alpha, \\
\alpha &= \dfrac{k}{\sqrt{t}} \times \alpha_0.
\end{aligned}
$$

### Problem of local optima

{:.img-70}
![Local optima problem.]({{img-url}}/local-optima.png)
_Local optima problem: local & right optima (left) and saddle point (right). Image from the course._

- In high dimension, you likely see saddle points than local optimum.
- **Problem of plateau**: a region where derivative is close to zero for a long time.
  - Unlikely get stuck in a bad local optimal.
  - Plateau can make learning slow: use Momentum, RMSprop, Adam.

### Batch GD makes learning too long?

- Try better random initialization for weights.
- Try mini-batch GD.
- Try using Adam
- Try tuning learning rate $\alpha$.

## Hyperparameter tuning

### Tuning process

- There are many hyperparameters but <mark>some are more important than others!</mark>
- Learning rate $\alpha$ (most important), #hiddien units, $\beta$, mini-batch size (2nd important), #layers, learning decay,...
- Don't use grid, use random!

{:.img-80}
![Tuning process]({{img-url}}/tuning-process.jpg)
_Tuning process. Don't use grid (left), use random (right). Image from the course._

- **Coarse to fine**: find an area containing effective values â‡’ zoom in and take more points in that area,

{:.img-40}
![Coarse to fine]({{img-url}}/coarse-to-fine.jpg)
_Coarse to fine: first try on a big square, then focus on the smaller one (blue). Image from the course._

- Choose randomly but NOT mean uniform scale! We can choose uniformly on #hidden units, #layers, but not for the others (e.g. $\alpha$).
- For $\alpha$, for example, we need to divide into equal "large" spaces and then use uniform.

{:.img-70}
![Appropriate scale for hyperparameters]({{img-url}}/app-scale-hp.jpg)
_Appropriate scale for hyperparameters. Image from the course._

- Hyperparameters for __exponentially weighted averages__:
  - We cannot try with values between $[0.9, 0.999]$ because,
    - $\beta: 0.9000 \to 0.9005$ : no much changes,
    - $\beta: 0.999 \to 0.995$ : huge impact!
  - Consider $1-\beta \in [10^{-1}, 10^{-3}]$ instead!

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    r &\in [-3, -1] \\
    1-\beta = 10^r &\Leftrightarrow \beta = 1-10^r
    \end{aligned}
    $$

### In practice: Panda vs Caviar

- How to organize your hyperparameter search?
- **Advice**: Re-testing/Re-evaluating your hyperparameters at least once every several months.
- 2 ways:
    1. **Babysitting one model** (<mark>Panda</mark>): when we have huge data but weak CPU/GPU $\Rightarrow$ try very small number of models at a time. Check the performance step by step (cost function reduces...)
        - In some domains like advertising, computer vision apps,...
        - We call "panda" because panda has very few number of babies at a time (and in their life) $\Rightarrow$ try to keep them alike once at a time.
    2. **Training many models in parallel** (<mark>Caviar</mark>): when we don't work on huge data + strong CPU/GPU. $\Rightarrow$ Try many models in parallel and choose the best performance!
        - We call "Caviar" because of intuition.

## Batch Normalization

- Make NN much more robust to the choice of hyperparameters. $\Leftarrow$ doesn't work for all NN but if it does, make training faster!
- <mark>One of the most important ideas</mark> in the rise of Deep Learning.
- Like we wanna normalize input to speed up learning, <mark markdown="span">in this case, we wanna normalize $Z$</mark> (in the hidden layers)

<div class="simple-box" markdown="1">

Given some initial values in NN $Z^{[l](1)},\ldots, Z^{[l](m)}$,

1. $\mu = \dfrac{1}{m} \sum_i Z^{[l](i)}$
2. $\sigma^2 = \dfrac{1}{m}\sum_i (Z^{[l](i)} - \mu)^2$
3. $Z^{[l](i)}_{\text{norm}} = \dfrac{Z^{[l](i)} - \mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^2} + \epsilon}$ to get mean $\mu=0$ and STD $\sigma=1$.
4. $\tilde{Z}^{[l](i)} = \gamma Z^{[l](i)}_{\text{norm}} + \beta$ to have different other normal distribution.

{:.mb-0}
<mark>Now, $\gamma, \beta$ are learnable parameters of the model.</mark>
</div>

- If we choose different $\beta, \gamma$ $\Rightarrow$ hidden units have other means & variances.
- Instead of using $Z^{[l](1)}, \ldots, Z^{[l](m)}$, we use $\tilde{Z}^{[l](i)}$.
- Difference between normalizing input $X$ and normalizing in hidden units:
  - $X$: after normalizing, $\mu=0, \sigma=1$.
  - $Z$: after normalizing, various $\mu, \sigma$.

$$
X \xrightarrow[]{W^{[1]}, b^{[1]}} Z^{[1]} \xrightarrow[\text{Batch Norm}]{\beta^{[1]}, \gamma^{[1]}} \tilde{Z}^{[1]} \to a^{[1]} = g^{[1]}(\tilde{Z}^{[1]}) \xrightarrow[]{W^{[2]}, b^{[2]}} Z^{[2]} \xrightarrow[\text{Batch Norm}]{\beta^{[2]}, \gamma^{[2]}} \tilde{Z}^{[2]} \to a^{[2]} \to \ldots
$$

- Note that, $\beta$ in this case is different from $\beta$ in [Adam optimization](#adam-optimization)!
- We can use gradient descent to update $\beta$ and **even use** Adam/RMSprop/Momentum to update params $\gamma, \beta$, not just for Gradient Descent.
- **In practice**, we won't have to implement Batch Norm step by step by ourself, programming framework (like Tensorflow) will do!
- **In practice**, Batch Norm is usually applied with mini-batch of your training set.
- **Parameters**: $W^{[l]}, \beta^{[l]}, \gamma^{[l]}$. We don't need to consider $b^{[l]}$ becase it will be subtracted out in the process of normalization!
- **Fitting Batch Norm into a NN**: for $t$ goes through the number of mini-batches,
    1. Compute forward prop on $X^{\{t\}}$.
    2. In each hidden layer, use Batch Norm to reparameter $Z^{[l]}$ to $\tilde{Z}^{[l]}$.
    3. Use backprop to compute $dW^{[l]}, d\beta^{[l]}, d\gamma^{[l]}$.
    4. Update params (we can use Momentum / RMSprop / Adam):

        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        W^{[l]} &:= W^{[l]} - \alpha dW^{[l]}, \\
        \beta^{[l]} &:= \beta^{[l]} - \alpha d\beta^{[l]}, \\
        \gamma^{[l]} &:= \gamma^{[l]} - \alpha d\gamma^{[l]}.
        \end{aligned}
        $$

- Sometimes, BN has a 2nd effect as a regularization technique but it's unintended! We don't use it for the purpose of regularization, use L1, L2 or dropout instead.

<div class="simple-box" markdown="1">
{:.mb-0}
(Recall) **Regularization**: techniques that lower the complexity of a NN during training, thus prevent the overfitting.
</div>

### Why BN works?

- Make weights in later / deeper layers be more robust to changing to the weights in the earlier layers.
- **Covariate shift problem**: suppose we have $X \to Y$. If $X$'s distribution changes, it changes the result in $Y$ much. We have to re-train our model.
  - Example: "cat vs non-cat" problem. If we apply params from the model of "black cat vs non-cat" to the problem of "colored-cat vs non-cat", it won't work because distribution in "black cat" is different from "colored cat".

{:.img-70}

_Covariate problem. Image from the course._

{:.img-60}
![Why BN works?]({{img-url}}/bn-work.jpg)
_Why BN works?. Image from the course._

In the perspective of layer 3, it depends only on layer 2 $\Rightarrow$ If layers before layer 2 changes $\Rightarrow$ distribution of layer 2 changes $\Rightarrow$ covariate shift problem for layer 3 $\Rightarrow$ Batch Norm makes sure that mean and variance in layer 2 is always robust before going to layer 3!

### Batch Norm in test time

- BN processes our data one min-batch at a time. However, in test time, you need to process the examples at a time. $\Rightarrow$ Need to adapt your network to do that.
- **Idea**: calculate $\mu, \sigma^2$ using _exponentially weighted average_ (across mini-batches). Other words,
  - In the training time, we calculate (and store) also the $\mu^{\{t\}[l]}, \sigma^{\{t\}[l]}$ in each mini-batch.
  - Find $\mu, \sigma^2$ (exponentially weighted average) of all mini-batches.
  - Use this $\mu, \sigma^2$ to find $Z_{\text{norm}}$ and $\tilde{Z}$ (at each example $i$).
- <mark>Don't worry, it's easy to use with Deep Learning Frameworks.</mark>

## Tensorflow introduction

Writing and running programs in TensorFlow has the following steps:

1. Create Tensors (variables) that are not yet executed/evaluated.
2. Write operations between those Tensors.
3. Initialize your Tensors.
4. Create a Session.
5. Run the Session. This will run the operations you'd written above.

``` python
# create placeholders
x = tf.placeholder(tf.int64, name = 'x')
X = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [n_x, None], name="X")

# initialize
W1 = tf.get_variable("W1", [25,12288], initializer = tf.contrib.layers.xavier_initializer(seed = 1))
b1 = tf.get_variable("b1", [25,1], initializer = tf.zeros_initializer())
```

There are two typical ways to create and use sessions in tensorflow:

1. Method 1:
    ```python
    sess = tf.Session()
    # Run the variables initialization (if needed), run the operations
    result = sess.run(..., feed_dict = {...})
    sess.close() # Close the session
    ```
2. Method 2:
    ```python
    with tf.Session() as sess:
        # run the variables initialization (if needed), run the operations
        result = sess.run(..., feed_dict = {...})
        # This takes care of closing the session for you :)
    ```

**What you should remember**:

- Tensorflow is a programming framework used in deep learning
- The two main object classes in tensorflow are Tensors and Operators.
- When you code in tensorflow you have to take the following steps:
    - Create a graph containing Tensors (Variables, Placeholders ...) and Operations (`tf.matmul`, `tf.add`, ...)
    - Create a session
    - Initialize the session
    - Run the session to execute the graph
- You can execute the graph multiple times as you've seen in model()
- The backpropagation and optimization is automatically done when running the session on the "optimizer" object.
