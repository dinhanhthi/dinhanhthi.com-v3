## Install

## Why strapi?

- [An alternative to wordpress](https://strapi.io/wordpress-alternative) with more customizable fields.
- Using NodeJS + built with JS.
- API-based CMS (headless cms): decoupled from their content management tools and integrated via API. This gives you the flexibility to build your front-end using your preferred tools.
