## What's the idea of Decision Tree Classifier?

The basic intuition behind a decision tree is to map out all possible decision paths in the form of a tree. It can be used for *classification* and *regression* ([note](/decision-tree-regression)). In this post, let's try to understand the classifier. 

Suppose that we have a dataset $S$ like in the figure below<sup>[[ref, *Table 1.2*]](https://books.google.fr/books/about/Data_Mining_Practical_Machine_Learning_T.html?id=bDtLM8CODsQC){:target="_blank"}</sup>,

*A decision tree we want.*
</div>

There are [many algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning#Decision_tree_types) which can help us make a tree like above, in Machine Learning, we usually use: 

- [**ID3**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm) (*Iterative Dichotomiser*): uses **information gain** / **entropy**.
- **[CART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning#Gini_impurity)** (*Classification And Regression Tree*): uses **Gini impurity**.

### Some basic concepts

{:.img-full-80}
![Concepts with a tree.]({{img-url}}/f5.jpg)

- **Splitting**: It is a process of dividing a node into two or more sub-nodes.
- **Pruning**: When we remove sub-nodes of a decision node, this process is called pruning.
- **Parent node and Child Node**: A node, which is divided into sub-nodes is called parent node of sub-nodes where as sub-nodes are the child of parent node.

### ID3 algorithm

**ID3 algorithm (TL;DR;)**
</button>
<div id="box2ct" markdown="1" class="collapse multi-collapse box-content">

1. To check the disorder at current node (let's say $S$, parent node), we calculate its **entropy** with,

    <p class="p-mark">
    $$
    H(S) = -\sum_{i=1}^{2} p_{S,i} \log_2 p_{S,i},
    $$
    </p>
    
    where $i \in$ the number of classes and $p_{S,i}$ is the probability of class $i$ in $S$.

2. If entropy at this node is **pure** (there is only 1 class or the majority is 1 class) or it meets [the stopping conditions](#when-to-stop), we stop splitting at this node. Otherwise, go to the next step.

3. Calculate the **information gain** (IG) after splitting node $S$ on each attribute (for example, consider attribute $O$). The attribute w.r.t. the biggest IG will be chosen!

    <p class="p-mark">
    $$
    \underbrace{IG(S,O)}_{\text{information gain}} 
    = \underbrace{H(S)}_{\text{entropy before split}}
    - \underbrace{\sum_j P(O_j | S) \times H(S,O_j)}_{\text{weighted entropy after split}}
    $$
    </p>

    where $j \in$ number of different properties in $O$ and $P(O_j)$ is the propability of property $O_j$ in $O$.

4. After splitting, we have new child nodes. Each of them becomes a new parent node in the next step. Go back to step 1.

<div id="box1ct" markdown="1" class="collapse multi-collapse box-content">

How we know we can split the dataset $S$ base on the **Outlook attribute** instead of the others (*Temperature, Humidity, Windy*)? $\Rightarrow$ We calculate the **information gain** after splitting $S$ on each attribute. *It’s the information which can increase the level of certainty after splitting*. The **highest one** will be chosen (after this section, you will see that the Outlook attribute has the highest information gain).

In order to calculate the information gain, we need "**entropy**" which is *the amount of information disorder or the amount of randomness in the data*.

<p class="p-mark">
$$
\text{information gain} = \text{entropy before split} - \text{weighted entropy after split}
$$
</p>

At the beginning, `entropy before split` ($H(S)$) shows us the disorder status of the whole dataset $S$. If $S$ contains only `Yes`, $S$ has no disorder or it's **pure** ($H(S)=0)$. If the amount of `Yes` and `No` in $S$ is equal, $S$ has the highest disorder ($H(S)=1$).

{:.img-full-80}
![Illustration of entropy with different proportions of Yes/No in S.]({{img-url}}/f6.jpg)
*An illustration of entropy with different proportions of Yes/No in $S$.*

At each node, we need to calculate again its entropy (corresponding to the number of `Yes` and `No` in this node.). We prefer **the lowest entropy**, of course! How can we calculate entropy of each node? More specifically, how to calculate $H(S)$?

<p class="p-mark">
$$
H(S) = -\sum_{i=1}^{2} p_{S,i} \log_2 p_{S,i},
$$
</p>

where $i \in$ the number of classes (node $S$ has 2 classes, `Yes` and `No`), $p_{S,i}$ is the probability of class $i$ in $S$.

{:.img-full-45}
![Graph of H(S) in the case there are 2 classes.]({{img-url}}/f11.svg)
*Graph of $H(p)$ in the case of 2 classes. Max is 1.*

{:.alert.alert-warning}
In this case we use $\log_2$ (binary logarithm) to obtain the maximum $H(S)=1$ and we also use a convention in which $0\times\log_2(0)=0$. There are other documents using $\log$ (natural logarithm) instead.

<div class="columns-2" markdown="1">
<div markdown="1">
On node $S$, we have,

$$
\begin{aligned}
H(S) &= H([9,5]) \\ 
&= -\frac{9}{14} \times \log_2(\frac{9}{14}) - \frac{5}{14}\times\log_2(\frac{5}{14})\\
&= 0.94.
\end{aligned}
$$

We see that, $S$ is not pure but it's also not totally disordered.
</div>

{:.img-full-normal}
![The frequency of classes in S]({{img-url}}/f1.jpg)
*The frequency of classes in S.*
</div> 

Because we are considering to split $S$ on $O$ (Outlook) and $O$ has 3 different properties which are *Sunny, Overcast* and *Rainy*. Corresponding to these properties, we have different sizes of `Yes`/`No` (Different nodes having different sizes of data but their total is equal to the size of $S$ which is their "parent" node.). That's why we need to calculate the **weighted entropy** (`weighted entropy after split`).

<p class="p-mark">
$$
\sum_{j=1}^3 P(O_j) \times H(S,O_j),
$$
</p>

where $j \in$ number of different properties in $O$ and $P(O_j)$ is the propability of property $O_j$ in $O$. Therefore, the information gain if split $S$ on $O$ is,

<p class="p-mark">
$$
IG(S,O) = H(S) - \sum_{j=1}^3 P(O_j) \times H(S,O_j).
$$
</p>

{:.img-full-normal.pop}
![If we split S in O?]({{img-url}}/f2.jpg)
*If we split S on Outlook (O), there will be 3 branches.*

For example, we consider branch $O_1$ (Sunny), it has $P(O_1)=\frac{5}{14}$ and entropy at this node, $H(S,O_1)$ is calculated as

<div class="columns-2" markdown="1">
$$
\begin{aligned}
H(S,O_1) &= H([2,3]) \\
&= -\frac{2}{5} \times \log_2(\frac{2}{5}) - \frac{3}{5}\times\log_2(\frac{3}{5})\\ 
&= 0.97.
\end{aligned}
$$

{:.img-full-normal}
![Only consider O1]({{img-url}}/f3.jpg)
*Only consider branch Sunny ($O_1$).*
</div>

Thus, the information gain after splitting $S$ on $O$ is,

$$
\begin{aligned}
IG(S,O) &= H(S) - \sum_{j=1}^3 P(O_j) \times H(S,O_j) \\
&= 0.94 - (\frac{5}{14}\times 0.971 + \frac{4}{14}\times 0 + \frac{5}{14}\times 0.971) \\
&= 0.94 - 0.693 = 0.247.
\end{aligned}
$$

With the same method, we can calculate the information gain after splitting $S$ on other attributes (Temperature, Windy, Humidity) and get,

{:.img-full-75.pop}
![Dataset is split into different ways.]({{img-url}}/dt-4.jpg)
*Dataset is split into different ways.*

We can see that, the winner is **Outlook** with **the highest information gain**. We split $S$ on that attribute first!

{:.img-full-normal.pop}
![Data is split on Outlook.]({{img-url}}/f9.jpg)
*Dataset is split on Outlook.*

How about 3 others remaining attributes (Temperature, Humidity, Windy), which one to be chosen next? Especially on branches Suuny and Humidity because on branch Overcast, this node is pure (all are `Yes`), we don't need to split any more. 

{:.img-full-50}
![Which attribute will be chosen next?]({{img-url}}/f10.jpg)
*There are remaining Temperature, Humidity, Windy. Which attribute will be chosen next?*

We repeat the steps again, for example, on the branch $O_1$ (Sunny), we calculate IG after splitting $O_1$ on each attribute Temperature (T), Humidity (H) or Windy (W). Other words, we need to calculate $IG(O_1,T)$, $IG(O_1, H)$ and $IG(O_1, W)$ and then compare them to find the best one. Let's consider $H$ (Humidity) as an example,

<div class="columns-2" markdown="1">
<div markdown="1">
$$
\begin{aligned}
IG(O_1,H) &= H(O_1) - \sum_{j=1}^2 P(H_j|O_1) \times H(O_1,H_j) \\
&= H(S,O_1) - \frac{3}{5}\times 0 - \frac{2}{5} \times 0 \\
&= 0.971.
\end{aligned}
$$

Nodes $W_1$ and $W_2$ are pure, that's why their entropy are $0$.
</div>

{:.img-full-75.pop#ttt}
![Consider branch O1 and attribute W]({{img-url}}/f4.jpg)
*Consider branch $O_1$ and attribute Windy (W).*
</div>

Similarly, we calculate $IG(O_1,T)$, $IG(O_1,H)$ and we see that $IG(O_1,W)$ is the biggest one! So we choose $W$ (Windy) to split at node $O_1$. On the branch $O_3$ (Rainy), the biggest information gain after splitting is on $H$ (Humidity).

{:.img-full-normal.pop}
![Example of dataset]({{img-url}}/dt-1.jpg)

From now, if we have a new input which contains information about *Outlook, Temperature, Humidity* and *Windy*, we go from the top of the tree and choose an appropriate branch to get the decision `Yes` or `No`.

</div>
</div>

### CART algorithm

<div class="hide-show-box">
<button type="button" markdown="1" class="btn collapsed box-button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#box5ct">
**CART algorithm (TL;DR;)**
</button>
<div id="box5ct" markdown="1" class="collapse multi-collapse box-content">

{:.alert.alert-warning}
The difference between two algorithms is the difference between $H(S)$ and $I_G(S)$.

1. To check the disorder at current node (let's say $S$, parent node), we calculate its **Giny Impurity** with,

    <p class="p-mark">
    $$
    I_G(S) = \sum_{i=1}^{2} p_{S,i}(1-p_{S,i}),
    $$
    </p>
    
    where $i \in$ the number of classes in $S$ and $p_{S,i}$ is the probability of class $i$ in $S$.

2. If entropy at this node is **pure** (there is only 1 class or the majority is 1 class) or it meets [the stopping conditions](#when-to-stop), we stop splitting at this node. Otherwise, go to the next step.

3. Calculate the **Gini Gain** (GG) after splitting node $S$ on each attribute (for example, consider attribute $O$). The attribute w.r.t. the biggest GG will be chosen!

    <p class="p-mark">
    $$
    \underbrace{GG(S,O)}_{\text{gini gain}} 
    = \underbrace{I_G(S)}_{\text{gini impurity before split}}
    - \underbrace{\sum_j P(O_j | S) \times I_G(S,O_j)}_{\text{weighted gini impurity after split}}
    $$
    </p>

    where $j \in$ number of different properties in $O$ and $P(O_j)$ is the propability of property $O_j$ in $O$.

4. After splitting, we have new child nodes. Each of them becomes a new parent node in the next step. Go back to step 1. 

</div>
</div>

<div class="hide-show-box">
<button type="button" markdown="1" class="btn collapsed box-button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#box6ct">
**CART algorithm in detail**
</button>
<div id="box6ct" markdown="1" class="collapse multi-collapse box-content">

It's quite the same to the ID3 algorithm except a truth that it's based on the definition of **Gini impurity** instead of **Entropy**. *Gini impurity is a measure of how often a randomly chosen element from the set would be incorrectly labeled if it was randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the subset.*

At every nonleaf node (which isn't pure), we have to answer a question "*Which attribute we should choose to split that node?*" We calculate the **Gini gain** for each split based on the attribute we are going to use. This *Gini gain* is quite the same as *Information gain*. The highest one will be chosen.

<p class="p-mark">
$$
\text{gini gain} = \text{gini impurity before split} - \text{weighted gini impurity after split}
$$
</p>

The **Gini Impurity** at node $S$ is calculated as,

<p class="p-mark">
$$
I_G(S) = \sum_{i=1}^2p_{S,i}(1-p_{S,i}),
$$
</p>

where $i\in$ the number of classes in $S$, $p_{S,i}$ is the probability of class $i$ in $S$. $I_G=0$ will be the best!

<div class="columns-2" markdown="1">
<div markdown="1">
On node $S$, we have,

$$
\begin{aligned}
I_G(S) &= I_G([9,5]) \\ 
&= \frac{9}{14} \times \frac{5}{14} + \frac{5}{14} \times \frac{9}{14}\\
&= 0.459.
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

{:.img-full-normal}
![The frequency of classes in S]({{img-url}}/f1.jpg)
*The frequency of classes in S.*
</div>

Similarly to the information gain, we can calculate **Gini Gain** ($GG$) after splitting $S$ on the property $O$ with,

<p class="p-mark">
$$
GG(S,O) = I_G(S) - \sum_{j=1}^3 P(O_j) \times I_G(S,O_j),
$$
</p>

where $j \in$ number of different properties in $O$ and $P(O_j)$ is the propability of property $O_j$ in $O$.

{:.img-full-normal.pop}
![If we split S in O?]({{img-url}}/f12.jpg)
*If we split S on Outlook (O), there will be 3 branches.*

Apply above equation, we calculate all GG if splitting $S$ on each property and get,

$$
\begin{aligned}
GG(S,O) &= I_G([9,5]) - ( \frac{5}{14}\times I_G([2,3]) + \frac{4}{14}\times I_G([4,0]) + \frac{5}{14}\times I_G([3,2])) \\
&= \ldots
\end{aligned}
$$

The same for $GG(S,H)$ (Humidity), $GG(S,T)$ (Temperature) and $GG(S,W)$ (Windy). Keep going the same arguments as in the section **ID3 in detail**, we will get the final tree. The difference between two algorithms is the difference between $H(S)$ and $I_G(S)$.

### Gini Impurity or Entropy? <sup>[[ref]](https://books.google.fr/books/about/Hands_on_Machine_Learning_with_Scikit_Le.html?id=I6qkDAEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y)</sup>

- Most of the time, they lead to similar trees.<sup>[[ref]](https://www.unine.ch/files/live/sites/imi/files/shared/documents/papers/Gini_index_fulltext.pdf)</sup>
- Gini impurity is slightly faster.<sup>[[ref]](https://www.unine.ch/files/live/sites/imi/files/shared/documents/papers/Gini_index_fulltext.pdf)</sup>
- Gini impurity tends to isolate the most frequent class in its own branch of the tree, while entropy tends to produce slightly more balanced trees.

## Good / Bad of Decision Tree?{% ref https://blog.easysol.net/machine-learning-algorithms-1 %}

Some highlight **advantages** of Decision Tree Classifier:

1. Can be used for regression or classification.
2. Can be displayed graphically.
3. Highly interpretable.
4. Can be specified as a series of rules, and more closely approximate human decision-making than other models.
5. Prediction is fast.
6. Features don't need scaling.
7. Automatically learns feature interactions.
8. Tends to ignore irrelevant features.
9. Non-parametric (will outperform linear models if relationship between features and response is highly non-linear).

Its **disadvantages**:

1. Performance is (generally) not competitive with the best supervised learning methods.
2. Can easily overfit the training data ([tuning](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22903267/what-is-tuning-in-machine-learning) is required).
3. Small variations in the data can result in a completely different tree (high variance).
4. Recursive binary splitting makes "locally optimal" decisions that may not result in a globally optimal tree.
5. Doesn't tend to work well if the classes are highly unbalanced.
6. Doesn't tend to work well with very small datasets.

## When to stop?

If the number of features are too large, we'll have a very large tree! Even, it easily leads to an [overfitting problem](/underfitting-overfitting). How to avoid them?

1. **Pruning**: removing the branches that make use of features having low importance.
2. Set a minimum number of training input to use on each leaf. If it doesn't satisfy, we remove this leaf. In [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier), use `min_samples_split`.
3. Set the maximum depth of the tree. In [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier), use `max_depth`.

## When we need to use Decision Tree?

- When explainability between variable is prioritised over accuracy. Otherwise, we tend to use [Random Forest]({/random-forest).
- When the data is more non-parametric in nature.
- When we want a simple model.
- When entire dataset and features can be used
- When we have limited computational power
- When we are not worried about accuracy on future datasets.
- When we are not worried about accuracy on future datasets.

## Using Decision Tree Classifier with Scikit-learn

### Load and create

Load the library,

~~~ python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
~~~

Create a decision tree ([other parameters](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier)):

~~~ python
